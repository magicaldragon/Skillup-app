# Admin Email Update and Personal Information Enhancement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to fix the admin account role confusion and enhance personal information editing capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Admin Email Domain Fix
**Problem**: The admin account was using `@teacher.skillup` domain, causing role confusion.

**Solution**: Changed admin email from `skillup-admin@teacher.skillup` to `admin@admin.skillup`

#### Files Updated:
- `functions/src/routes/auth.ts` - Updated role assignment logic
- `constants.tsx` - Updated initial user data
- `services/userRegistrationService.ts` - Already had correct admin domain logic
- All documentation files (FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md, HYBRID_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md, etc.)
- All backend scripts in `backend/scripts/`

### 2. Enhanced Greeting Logic
**Problem**: Greeting was using displayName or name, but should prioritize English name.

**Solution**: Updated greeting to use: `englishName || displayName || name`

#### Files Updated:
- `AdminDashboard.tsx` - Updated welcome message
- `TeacherDashboard.tsx` - Updated welcome message

### 3. Enhanced Personal Information Editing
**Problem**: Admin/teacher/staff couldn't edit their personal information and avatar.

**Solution**: Enhanced SettingsPanel to allow editing of:
- Full Name
- Display Name  
- English Name
- Gender
- Date of Birth
- Phone Number
- Avatar (DiceBear style and seed)
- Custom avatar upload

#### Files Updated:
- `SettingsPanel.tsx` - Added comprehensive editing capabilities
- `functions/src/routes/users.ts` - Already had PUT endpoint for user updates

## Scripts Created

### 1. `scripts/updateAdminEmail.js`
Simple script to update admin email in Firestore and Firebase Auth.

### 2. `scripts/updateAllAdminReferences.js`
Comprehensive script that:
- Updates admin email in Firestore
- Updates admin email in Firebase Auth
- Verifies role assignment logic
- Provides step-by-step feedback

## Role Assignment Logic

The updated logic correctly assigns roles based on email domains:
- `@admin.skillup` → admin role
- `@teacher.skillup` → teacher role  
- `@student.skillup` → student role
- `@staff.skillup` → staff role

## Testing Instructions

1. **Run the update script**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   node updateAllAdminReferences.js
   ```

2. **Test login with new credentials**:
   - Email: `admin@admin.skillup`
   - Password: `Skillup@123`

3. **Verify greeting shows English name** (if available)

4. **Test personal information editing**:
   - Login as admin/teacher/staff
   - Go to Settings
   - Click "Edit Profile"
   - Modify personal information
   - Save changes
   - Verify changes persist

1. **Deploy Firebase Functions**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
